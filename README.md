  - [x] We propose a novel MOFE framework SplatFlow designed explicitly for the single-resolution iterative two-frame backbones. 
  - [x] Compared with the original backbone, SplatFlow has significantly higher estimation accuracy, especially in occluded regions, while maintaining a high inference speed.
  - [x] At the time of submission, our SplatFlow achieved state-of-the-art results on both the [Sintel](http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/quant?metric_id=0&selected_pass=1) and [KITTI2015](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?benchmark=flow) benchmarks, especially with surprisingly significant 19.4% error reductions compared to the previous best result submitted on the Sintel benchmark.

## Updates
- [April 24, 2024] üì£ The code of SplatFlow is now available!
- [January 02, 2024] üì£ The paper of SplatFlow is accepted by IJCV 2024!

## Environment

Our code has been successfully tested in the following environments:

* NVIDIA 3090 GPU
* CUDA 11.1
* Python 3.8
* PyTorch 1.8.2
```
conda create -n splatflow python=3.8
conda activate splatflow

pip install torch==1.8.2 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/lts/1.8/cu111
pip install einops==0.4.1
pip install cupy-cuda111
pip install pillow==9.5.0
pip install opencv-python==4.1.2.30
```

## Quick start
To make the model (with [weights](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1v3WiEzkAXPtchVxEDu-vRw&pwd=sm11) after K-finetune) infer on KITTI data, run
```Shell
python main.py
```
